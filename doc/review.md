# Literature review on some aspects of the project

## Spiking network dynamics

Previous models of sparse representations in spiking networks (Kremkow et al., 2010; King et al., 2013).

Sparse vs Dense activity: (Zerlaut et al., 2019)

## Natural Images processing

#### Responses are 

#### Stimulus design

Natural images with virtual eye movement (Vinje and Gallant, 2000; Baudot et al., 2013).

"We create repeatable explorations of visual scenes by "


#### Cortical networks are optimized for the encoding of natural sensory scenes

Efficient coding hypothesis (Barlow, 1961; ...), reviewed in Simoncelli and Olshausen (2001).


#### Classical Receptive Field weakly explains response to natural scenes

--> need tweaking (David et al., 2004)

#### Stim details

(Baudot et al., 2013)

#### In the thalamus

Desbordes et al. (2008) 

#### State dependency during wakefulness

(Froudarakis et al., 2014)

We found that the population representation of natural movies was highly state dependent in awake animals. This seems to be a general feature of visual processing in the primary visual cortex of mice.  For example, firing rates are higher during running than during quiet wakefulness 28,29 upon stimulation with oriented gratings.  In addition, activity during running resembles activity under anesthesia 28 , in agreement with our data (Fig. 6). In contrast, neurons appear “visually detached” during quiet wakefulness 28 and visual performance is lower 30


#### Excitatory-Inhibitory components

Inhibition is selectively increased in NCRF stimulation


(Haider et al., 2010)
