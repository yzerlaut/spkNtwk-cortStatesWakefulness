#+Title: Spiking network dynamics enables flexible computations across waking states in sensory cortex

* Abstract

Despite the large amount of experimental evidence highlighting the critical role of state-dependent computations in the awake sensory cortex, a theoretical framework providing a mechanistic and functional description of this phenomenon is still lacking. The present study builds a minimal spiking network model of a local cortical assembly and examines its dynamical and computational properties (and compares ... with neurophysiological recordings in the awake behaving mouse). It is first shown that a weak intrinsic rhythmicity coupled with competing inhibitory and disinhibitory circuits allow recurrent spiking networks to generate the set of dynamical regimes observed at various arousal levels in rodent sensory cortices (also known as the “U-model” of cortical states). We then test the functional specificity of such network states in two vision-inspired tasks. In a natural scene discrimination task, the network encoding is found to be optimal (highly-reliable) when displaying the sparse activity regime associated to intermediate arousal levels. In a low contrast detection task, the network is optimally detecting (high-sensitivity) when displaying the dense activity regime found at high arousal levels. Finally, the rhythmic activity characterizing the idling cortex is shown to insure unambiguous transitions between the high-reliability and high-sensitivity modes of cortical activity, thus giving it a a functional role. This theoretical model therefore demonstrates a key function of spiking networks: they can implement an unambiguous switch between high-reliability and high-sensitivity modes. 

This feature might be one of the defining principle of sensory perception during active 

 underlying the context-dependent modulation of perception is to implement an adaptive strategy to reliably switch between high-reliability and high-sensitivity modes and therefore .

*** Intro

The variable nature of information transmission in neuronal networks is a puzzling aspect of the computation performed by sensory cortices. Indeed, unlike artificial intelligent systems that extract information by fixed transformations of incoming signals, the cortical representations of sensory features are highly variable across repeated presentations of a given stimulus (REFS). 

A striking feature of information processing in the sensory cortex of awake animals 

Over the last three decades, in vivo physiology has clearly established that the modulation of signal processing by the internal brain dynamics is a hallmark of cortical function (Arieli et al., 1996).
Since the early/seminal evidence that the ongoing dynamics of neural activity was critically shaping cortical computations [1], much effort has been devoted to the understanding of the functional role of such a phenomenon. Recent research in awake rodents has highlighted the correlation between behavioral and physiological states and specific network regimes in neocortex [2,3]. Such findings thus led to the idea that the regimes of cortical activity are the substrate underlying the functional flexibility (Cardin, 2019; McGinley et al., 2015b).
In this paper, we tackle this question with theoretical modeling of spiking network dynamics to focus our investigation on spike-based computation.

Recent investigation in the cortex of awake rodents have made this 
In parallel, psychophysical studies have pinpointed the critical role of the behavioral and physiological state in controlling perception.  
The circuits and mechanisms have been the fo

*** Dynamics - the U-model of arousal

The U-model of arousal is defined by a $V_m$ pattern in pyramidal cells as this quantitiy has been evidenced as a robust experimental signature of cortical states (McGinley et al., 2015b). 

[[Figure {dynamics} around here]]

*** Dynamics - setting up the model
We first investigate what are the minimal biophysical and circuit ingredients to reproduce the set of cortical regimes during wakefulness as captured by the U-model of arousal. Following an emerging consensus (McGinley et al., 2015a), we define the U-model of cortical states by its $V_m$ signature in pyramidal cells, (Figure {dynamics}a)


We embed a subpopulation of layer 5 excitatory neurons with oscillatory ionic currents, giving them the ability to display the rhythmic spiking , similarly to findings under anesthesia. 
For the rhythmic part, we adapt

To derive a general dynamical picture and prevent the emergent dynamics to depend on specific assymetries of biophysical parameters, we set all cellular and synaptic parameters identical. The only degree of freedom shaping individual population dynamics in this minimal model of the cortical assembly is the connectivity 

To capture the effective strength of each circuit components with a single parameter, we set all cellular and synaptic properties as equal and the only degree of freedom of the model is the 7x5 connectivity matrix (). 

The equation for the neuron i was:
\begin{equation}
C_m \frac{dV}{dt} =\frac{1}{Rm} \, (V_m-E_L) + I_{syn}(t) 
\end{equation}
The membrane parameters were $E_L$=-75mv, $C_m$=200pF, Rm =100MΩ, Vthre=-50mV and Vreset=EL, and Isyn(t) is the total synaptic currents targeting a neuron. The synaptic 

*** Dynamics - investigation

Following evidences of subcortical control (Reimer et al., 2014a), I hypothesize a single variable controlling arousal-mediated, capturing cholinergic input
we investigate the dynamics as function of this variable

Fig 1. 

To explore the network dynamics in this 49-dimensional space (7x7 connectivity probabilities), we make use of the analytical reduction of the network dynamics as numerical investigations is too computationnally expensive (intractable/prohibitove/unfeasible). 
investigate network dynamics at the time scale of network state modulation (>1s)

gaining 3 orders of magnitude in computation time for a single simulation (from $\sim$10s to $\sim$0.1s)

The wide gamma envelope ([20,80]Hz) in the mean-field is approximated by computing the fraction of the $V_m$ variance due to the inhibitory synaptic events targetting the pyramidal population. 

Such an analytical reduction of the network dynamics, also known as a mean-field description, to perform the connectivity parameter search. Those analytical estimates were confirmed by numerical simulations of the spiking network, in particular the optimal configuration was found 

*** Dynamics - Results

Remarkably we found that the connnectivity schemes allowing the closely resemble the canonical scheme of cortical circuit (Jiang et al., 2015), we therefore identify (see Figure {1})

The largest inhibitory population was found to highly connect to pyramidal cell, to balance the recurrent dynamics at high-activity level (see current weight inset in Figure {dynamics}e(ii)), i.e. matching the PV basket-cell type of inhibition.

The second largest population was providing tonic inhibition during rhythmic periods and decreased

Finally, it should be noted that a 5 population model containing the three stereotypical inhibitory populations (PV, SST, VIP) could display the same behavior with .

*** Role of rhythmic

At that point, two crucial questions emerge. What is the functional role of the non-zero endogenous activity found at low arousal ? Such rhythmic pattern make it difficult to be optimal for the transmission of sensory-evoked activity. 
Given the ability of a cortical network to adapt its functional mode, there is the need for a downstream network to decode such mode so that the readout process can be modulated as well. How does that decoding works and what insures it's reliability ?
 one might hypo . I therefore tested the ability of the resting state pattern to disambiguate the decoding of a

Because the two function-specific desynchronized regimes are either a globally more inhibited or a globally more activated state with respect to the rhythmic pattern,  it allows an unambiguous and reliable decoding of network state modulation by a recipient network.

Despite the large body of experimental work highlighting the critical
role of state-dependent computations in the awake cortex, a
theoretical framework providing a mechanistic and functional
description of this phenomenon is still lacking. The present study
builds a minimal spiking network model of a local cortical assembly
and examines its dynamical and computational properties. It is first
shown that a weak intrinsic rhythmicity coupled with competing
inhibitory and disinhibitory circuits allow recurrent spiking networks
to generate the set of dynamical regimes known as the “U-model” of
cortical states: the regimes observed at various arousal levels in
rodent sensory cortices. We then test the functional specificity of
such network states in two vision-inspired tasks. In a natural scene
discrimination task, the network encoding is found to be optimal
(high-reliability) when displaying the sparse activity regime
associated to intermediate arousal levels. In a low contrast detection
task, the network is optimally detecting (highly-sensitive) when
displaying the high-sensitivity dense activity regime found at high
arousal levels. Finally, the model proposes a functional role for the
rhythmic activity characterizing the idling cortex, it insures
unambiguous transitions between the high-reliability and
high-sensitivity modes of cortical activity. This theoretical analysis
suggests that the key functional constraint governing cortical
dynamics and function is the switch between high-reliablity and
high-sensitivity modes of recurrent dynamics and demonstrates that
spike-based interactions in recurrent networks allow to implement a
switch between high-reliability and high-sensitivity modes of
recurrent and suggests that such strategy.


This theoretical work demonstrates that spike-based interactions in
recurrent networks allow to implement a reliable switch between
high-reliability and high-sensitivity modes of signal processing. This
suggests that this principle is the key functional constraint
governing cortical operation in the awake cortex.
